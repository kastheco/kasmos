Review the implementation of plan: {{PLAN_NAME}}

Plan file: {{PLAN_FILE}}

Read the plan file to understand the goals, architecture, and tasks that were implemented.

IMPORTANT: Only review changes from this branch. Use `git diff main..HEAD` to see exactly
what was changed by the implementation — do NOT review code that was inherited from main.
Files may contain code from main that is outside the scope of this plan.

Load the `requesting-code-review` superpowers skill for structured review methodology.

Focus areas:
- Does the implementation match the plan's stated goals and architecture?
- Were any tasks implemented incorrectly or incompletely?
- Code quality, error handling, test coverage
- Regressions or unintended side effects introduced by this branch's changes
