### Prompt 1

Plan create-fix-agent-and-skill. Goal: create a debugging skill and agent type (should probably replace custodian) that's equipped to handle custodian's work but more importantly, is specialized in debugging and investigating issues, tieing up loose ends and targeted verification. Use the `kasmos-planner` skill. The plan MUST include ## Wave N sections (at minimum ## Wave 1) grouping all tasks — kasmos requires Wave headers to orchestrate implementation.
